# Chump Code Challenge
This is a barebones application whose structure is similar to the applications we use at Stukent. It is a `React.js` application with all the bells and whistles.

## Getting Started:
1. Star this repository
2. Install the latest version of `node.js`
3. Fork this repository so you can make edits
4. `git clone` on your forked copy
5. `cd chump` on your local machine
6. `npm i` to install node modules.
7. `npm start` to start the development server
8. Go to `localhost:3031` in your browser and register.
9. Start hacking.

## Instructions:
Take this template and make it look and feel like a real application. It has the potential to be a nice chat application like Slack, HipChat, or Rocket Chat. It just needs a little love.

I have built this template as a starting point for this challenge to find another JavaScript developer. We are are hoping for someone who *can flat-out code* and *learn quickly*.

The tools used in this application are the current industry standard, and likely years ahead of what you're used to. Do not panic. Ask questions. Search the internet. Work the problem.

Here are a couple links that may help:

## Server Code
The server for Chump is already hosted for you at http://coding-challenge-js.stukent.com and open source at https://github.com/Synvox/champ.
